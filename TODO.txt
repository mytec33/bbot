Enhancement
===========

After first guess if we have more than say 75 words, let's 
add 't', 's', 'r' 'n', 'c', and 'l' to the search for the second
word.

E.g., magic strap
    - 264 words remaining
    - algo is looking for 'a' and 'e' because 'a' is common in other locations
        - this looks for "above" which helps but not a whole lot 264 -> 64

Since we only have two, we could add 't', 's', 'r' to the search list which
would cast the net much wider.
